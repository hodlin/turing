Turing Machine for subtraction two integer values
-------------------------------------------------
Script written with third version of Python interpreter

States table of subtraction algorithm for Turing machine used for this
program could be found under the next link:

Behaviour
---------
Program prompts for two values: 'minuend' - number from which subtract
and 'take' - number that should be subtracted.

Note:
For algorithm used 'minuend' should greater or equal to 'take'.

How to run:
-----------
To run the program you can use on of the two following ways:

1. in the terminal run 'run_console.py' script using python3 interpreter:
	$ python3 run_console.py

2. make sure file 'run_console.py' has execution rights, and python three
interpreter placed in '/user/bin':
	$ sudo chmod a+x run_console.py
	$ ./run_console.py
